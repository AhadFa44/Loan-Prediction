# 📊 Loan Prediction with Machine Learning

This project aims to automate and improve the loan approval process using machine learning. By analyzing applicant data, the system helps financial institutions predict whether an individual is eligible for a loan.

---

## 📘 Introduction

A loan is a debt between two parties: a financial institution and a borrower. Applying for a loan often involves complex steps. With the rise of financial activity and growing demand, banks now receive hundreds of loan applications daily, making automation essential.

---

## 💡 Motivation

- Banks and financial institutions receive many loan requests every day.
- Granting loans depends on the applicant’s repayment capability, work status, salary, and credit history.
- Traditionally, bank staff manually evaluate loan applications using set criteria.

This project helps reduce manual effort by automating the classification and evaluation of loan applications.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

This system assists banks in:

1. Classifying clients based on personal data and past repayment history.
2. Suggesting eligible clients for loans.
3. Saving time and effort in analyzing loan requests.
4. Automating data entry and decision-making for loan approvals.

## 🛠️ Proposed Solution

A machine learning-based system that:

- Predicts whether a customer is eligible for a loan.
- Trains a model on real-world loan data using Support Vector Machine (SVM).
- Automates the prediction and validation process with minimal human intervention.
